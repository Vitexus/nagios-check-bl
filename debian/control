Description: This plugin checks the clamscan scan summary if any infected files were found.
 The plugin checks various scenarios:
 -the last scan was too long ago
 -the current scan runs too long (e.g. clamscan hangs on an infected file)
 -an infected file is listed in the scan summary
 -the scan summary log could not be parsed correctly
 -the scan summary log could not be opened by the plugin for parsing (e.g. plugin is not called with the correct log file path)
 -If clamscan is currently running, the pid of the process is printed
 -If the scan output could be parsed successfully, the engine version and the performance data of the scan are printed
